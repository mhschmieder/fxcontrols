/**
 * Actions can be classified by verbs that describe what they do in abstract
 * terms, which in turn can be useful towards deciding what kind of control to
 * use to expose the action. For instance, one might be an exclusive "choice".
 * <p>
 * DO = typical action that invokes a method directly, or shows a control
 * CHECK = binary variable whose two states are exact opposites; uses check box
 * TOGGLE = binary valued variable, usually shown with a toggle button
 * CHOOSE = mutually exclusive choice, generally modeled with radio buttons
 * SELECT = inclusive or exclusive choice from longer list, requiring container
 * SPIN = action to choose a value via incremental +/- from a finite list
 * PICK_DATE = action to pick a date using the Time/Date API for representation
 * PICK_COLOR = action to pick a color using a specialized control
 * <p>
 * Only the first three can be modeled directly by special Menu Item classes;
 * the others act as "DO" in that context but may launch a window or control to
 * complete the action, and if used as a generator for a button or control in a
 * tool bar or elsewhere outside a menu bar or context menu, give additional
 * hints as to what type of control to make (otherwise we would only know when
 * to make a Button or a Toggle Button, and maybe a Radio Button).
 * <p>
 * We distinguish between toggle actions that should be modeled as a check for
 * on/off, as a binary choice does not always imply opposites. To be clear, a
 * check box doesn't change its text, but a toggle button usually does. We
 * should try to be consistent about this rationale across the application.

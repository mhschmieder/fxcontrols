# The file CommonActionLabels_en_GB.properties is the shared "Action" resource
# bundle for the Great Britain locale using English. It overrides only those 
# resources in the default bundle where the most common spellings differ in 
# Great Britain from the USA. Note that Canada is different too, but closer to
# USA spellings.
#
# Note that action accelerators are currently universal vs. locale-specific.
